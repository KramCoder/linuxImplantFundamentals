# Linux Implant Fundamentals Course Repo

This is the template repository for the Hopper's Roppers Linux Implant Fundamentals course. It contains a variety of template code, and the course content is also in the repo in [resources/course](resources/course/README.md). This course was developed fully independent of criminal experience, classified information, or trade secrets. There's some solid material in here, but it is lacking polish. 

The course will have you clone this repo and commit assignments to your fork. 

If you have feedback, questions, or comments, hit me at d.m.devey@gmail.com or on the Slack. If you want [access to the course on Roppers](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=13), register for the site and hit me on Slack with your email.
