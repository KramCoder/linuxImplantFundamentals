# Linux Implant Fundamentals Course Repo

This is the template repository for the Hopper's Roppers Linux Implant Fundamentals course. It contains a variety of template code, and the course content is also in the repo in [resources/course](resources/course/README.md). 

Every once in a while, you get one of those ideas, and even though you know it's not a great idea, you decide to do it anyway. Well, I'm far enough along on my Fundamentals of Linux Implant Development course now that it's time to post it.

Without further ado, may I present the best (and only) Linux implant development training on the internet that was provably developed independent of criminal experience, knowledge of classified information, or trade secrets. As I might actually start working soon I decided to get this out there before I compromise the material by getting experience that would actually qualify me to teach such a course.

Feel free to use this to teach yourself and your people things they ordinarily wouldn't be able to learn outside of a dark windowless room with NDAs.

If you have feedback, questions, or comments, hit me at d.m.devey@gmail.com or on Slack. If you want [access to the course on Roppers](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=13), register for the site and hit me on Slack with your email.
