# Download and Execute
Now it's time to build a classic dropper and actually have this baby do something!

Implement a function to download a file at a location set at compile time and execute it. Make sure that this works for both 32 and 64 bit Linux machines. 

Additionally, build a function that sets the download location at time of activation by portknock.
