## [Hopper's Roppers Security Courses](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/)

We offer a variety of other courses on our site, mostly aimed at getting a beginning student up to speed on computing skills. 

Our flagship course, is [Ropper's Computing Fundamentals](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html), designed to give a beginner in the cyber security field the knowledge and skills required to be successful in the field. It teaches security fundamentals along with a strong technical foundation that students will build on for years to come.

I highly recommend you check that course out and send it to anyone you know who is looking to find a formalized path into this world. In fact, that's about the best thing you can do right now. 

We also have a great [Intro. to CTF ](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/courseCTF.html) and an [Intro. to Security](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/courseSecurity.html) that are great places to begin specializing beyond basic skills.

So yeah, welcome to Hopper's Roppers, the best place on the internet to take your first steps into the security field, or now, to become an APT.
